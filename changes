Revision history for Perl extension VMS::SysInfo.

0.01  Tue Aug 26 16:46:40 1997
    - Copied from VMS::ProcInfo.

0.02  Fri Aug 29 09:09:14 1997
    - Fixed a problem with the tied hash and object interface where they'd
      always return info on the local node, but had the calling process'
      PID (!) marked as the node name.
    - Added support for getting system parameters with get_sys_parm
      functions. They return info for the local node only, unfortunately.

0.03  Thu Sep 04 09:09:14 1997
    - Fixed a bug in the bit_test macro--bitwise and is &, not &&. D'oh!

0.04  Tue Sep 16 10:14:20 1997
    - Added a bunch more system parameters. All of the non-SPECIAL ones
      from Appendix J of the System Manager's manual, actually.

0.05  Tue Sep 16 16:00:01 1997
    - Added in the SPECIAL parameters from Appendix J
    - Added a bunch of #ifdefs to make it compatible with VMS 6.2
